# Snakes
A snakes game I made during my freshman summer of high school. Includes a 2-player multiplayer version and special powerups!

To launch the game, either open the .pde file with processing or open one of the exported applications. For Mac users, look in the folder
application.macosx, windows users application.windows and linux users application.linux.

Enjoy!
